It continues this pattern of hitting each wall and changing direction.\n\nBy counting each time the Magenta circle hits a wall and changes direction, we can determine the total number of changes.\n\nAfter careful observation, the Magenta circle changes its direction 14 times after hitting a wall.\n\nTherefore, the best option is:\nB. 14",
